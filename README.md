Git Hook Examples
=================

Just a small collection of some example [git hooks] to help automate
development / deployment in a git-centric workflow.

Most of these examples cite "[A Web-focused Git Workflow][git workflow]" by Joe
Maller as that's where I first learned about using git hooks. I highly
recommend reading [that post][git workflow] if you want to learn more about how
these things work.
